            The WFL is a fantasy football league born during the height of the
            COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, forged through nightly Call of Duty: Warzone
            sessions among friends. The Haaretz has said "we're a vibrant and rich universe".

            Originally composed of 10 members, the league had a merger with the WBWA

            Fabian, Jere, Eric, Daniel, Andres, Mesa, Parker, Andy, and Jonah.
