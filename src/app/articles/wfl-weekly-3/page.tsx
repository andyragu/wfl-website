                <p>With everyone under the sun seemingly getting engaged recently, love must be in the air. And just as everyone else is getting married to each other, our WFL GMs are adjusting to married life with their teams. Marriage (I think) has a lot to do with accepting certain quirks and flaws, and loving your partner for what they are. And our GMs are quickly learning just how many flaws their partners/teams have. However, unlike in real life marriage, in fantasy football it is not frowned upon to make changes to your partner/team in the image you see fit. Trading all your girlfriend&rsquo;s clothes with another girl just because you don&rsquo;t like her style, probably wouldn&rsquo;t go over very well. In any case, our GMs are just starting to get out of their honeymoon phases with their teams, and realizing what imperfections they might have (and in some cases there are many). Who is looking forward to a long and fruitful marriage on a sunset cruise with their teams? Who is sailing on rocky waters and trying to brave the storm? And who is ready to throw their bride overboard and start anew? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>
                <p>Without further ado, let&rsquo;s rock n roll</p>
                <p><br></br></p>

                <p><strong>Biggest Winner:</strong></p>
                <p>Came (Daniel) - What a difference a week can make. After most of the league wrote off Came as a potentially historically bad team, they stayed the course and knocked off The Bang Bros who were flying high. It&rsquo;s one of the most shocking upsets in WFL History and one that could prove as a huge momentum shift for Daniel and his rag tag bunch. We had the chance to sit down and interview Daniel after his whirlwind week, asking him all about the criticism he&rsquo;s faced from his peers recently, and what this victory meant to the man they call Peach. When asked about his league shaking win, he told us &quot;I think the shock of my team&rsquo;s victory proved something about this league&mdash;something that has been brewing under the surface for quite some time. You see, Mr. Reid, this league is filled with managers who delude themselves into believing they are prophetic. They grapple and scheme to control their little teams, sweating out the outcome of their matchup every week. Sure, I won. But to my team, this victory means very little. It proves nothing that I did not already know. Consider last week a warning, whispered to the league as they continue to lose their minds: you will never find the sense of control you seek, but that fear you feel is real. Week by week, my team will continue to improve. The more time that passes, the more fearful you should be.&quot; Strong words from a GM who will never be denied, and knows no league in which he abandons the spotlight. We will wait and see just how this victory translates going forward for Daniel, but as for last week:</p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p>He Came, he saw, and he conquered The Bang Bros.</p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p><strong>Other Winners:</strong></p>
                <p>This is a call for help (Parker) - A normal week likely would&rsquo;ve seen Parker&rsquo;s squad as this week&rsquo;s Biggest Winner, but he was just edged out by Daniel for that honor. Regardless, it was an eye-opening result for This is a call for help. A league-wide season high 186.8 points was plenty enough to absolute obliterate Johnny&rsquo;s Golden Boys, in a true statement victory. 26+ points out of Drake Maye, Puka Nacua, James Cook, and an emerging Rome Odunze paved the way to an utterly dominating showing that has many wondering if this is finally his year. Up next is undoubtedly his biggest test yet, as he faces a strong KRAFT YAC &amp; CHEESE team that is eager to get back to its winning ways. Name change incoming?</p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p>Take us to Valhalla Lamar (Andy) -<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>Through two weeks, Andy&rsquo;s squad has been consistently near the top of scoring, and that has translated to a 2-0 record thus far. The key cog in the machine, true to his team&rsquo;s name, has been none other than Lamar Jackson. The #1 fantasy QB thus far has lit it up in successive weeks, and top draft picks Ceedee Lamb and Christian McCaffrey have been as good as advertised. That being said, Andy can&rsquo;t keep still for long. Expect a trade from Take us to Valhalla Lamar sooner rather than later. A matchup with an old friend who is very keen for an upset will be a good watch this weekend as Andy looks to sweep his first two divisional matchups.</p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p><strong>Biggest Loser:</strong></p>
                <p>Why you gotta up an jittleyang (Eric) - It has truly been a rough couple weeks for Eric&rsquo;s squad to start the season, as a poor showing in Week One was followed up with his team&rsquo;s Week Two being over almost before it began. Jayden Reed breaking his collarbone on a score that got called back, and Joe Burrow suffering a toe injury that will have him out until December is a pretty awful turn of events. With things looking bleak, we sat down with Eric to ask him about his outlook on his team&rsquo;s season and what changes he feels he can make to turn things around. He told us &quot;I&rsquo;m going to end up having to do exactly what i always do. make a miraculous trade that puts me back in the race. Fortunately, i haven&rsquo;t seen the best from my team yet and we still aren&rsquo;t out of it just yet.&quot; Optimism is certainly a dying art when it comes to fantasy football, so hopefully for jittleyang, these words from their GM will inspire some confidence in them as they face a tough test this weekend against a hungry Marvin&rsquo;s Room.</p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p><strong>Other Losers:</strong></p>
                <p>The Bang Bros (Andres) - To reiterate what was written in the Biggest Winners section, what a difference a week can make. After soaring to a league high in points in Week One, it looked like the original Bang Bro was in for a storybook season. The WFL doesn&rsquo;t do fairytales though, and the hype train came crashing to an extreme and abrupt halt about as soon as it began, as Daniel Came away with an upset victory. Andres might have lost this game more than Daniel won it, as an extremely poor performance all around resulted in a real head-scratcher of a result. It is already becoming clear that this team truly will go as far as Josh Allen takes it, as the starting RBs for The Bang Bros have been very subpar to start off this season. Andres said he was going to ride Josh Allen as far as he could and he seems to be right on the money so far. With a masterful and disastrous performance under his belt, a big test against Wake and Baker Co. should provide a lot of answers into which team this really is going forward.</p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p>Golden Boys (Johnny) - Like with Daniel, we will give Johnny a slight bit of grace when it comes to these placings given what he had to work with. That being said, the results have been rough so far. An 88 point Week One followed by a league-low 104 points in Week 2 in a rivalry matchup, are not good enough to be competitive in the WFL right now. Trades this week did improve the roster and provide some help to a struggling RB room, so things could start looking better soon, but an 82 point loss to perhaps your biggest rival is not an easy taste to get out of your mouth. Can Johnny&rsquo;s improved Golden Boys score enough to avoid being 0-2 in divisional play? A win against Worse than WHL would take a lot of pressure off the trade-happy GM.</p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p><strong>Donuts! (Sponsored by Tough Cookie Inc.):</strong></p>
                <p>Once again there weren&rsquo;t many donuts to go around this week, but there were plenty of players who came dangerously close to receiving the painful pastry. The jelly-filled floodgates will surely open soon&hellip;</p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p>üç© Geno Smith (I ‚ù§Ô∏è Ohio) - Despite a big investment in Bo Nix during the WFL Draft, Ale opted to make the bold play of benching Nix in favor of Geno Smith after a lackluster Week One performance. Was he rewarded? No. Geno in fact scored -2.8, one of the worst performances in recent WFL History. Had Ale have even started his girlfriend, Sierra at QB, his team would have finished with more points. And she wasn&rsquo;t happy about it either, telling us &quot;He put the -2.8 in 28-3&quot;.</p>
                <p>Yes this is a real quote.</p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p>üç© Jayden Reed (jittleyang) - Through rain or shine, injured or not, the Donut section spares no one. Reed was injured on a 1st Quarter touchdown catch that was truly a great effort. But alas, a holding penalty ripped that score away. Oh and Reed also fell on his collarbone, broke it, and needless to say did not return. Highs and lows were a truly appropriate name for last week&rsquo;s WFL Weekly.</p>

                <p><strong>Kyle Pitts + George Pickens ‚áÜ Sam LaPorta + Javonte Williams</strong></p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p>üìä <strong>Grades:</strong></p>
                <p>&ndash; Pitts/Pickens side: <strong>C+</strong> (youthful talent, but inconsistent)</p>
                <p>&ndash; LaPorta/Javonte side: <strong>A-</strong> (top-tier TE plus RB upside = strong foundation)</p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p>AI has analyzed&mdash;this one leans toward LaPorta/Javonte. Clearer path to production, fewer &ldquo;what-ifs.&rdquo;</p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p>And yes, the SAME manager who once banned AI from league media doesn&rsquo;t want to hear it. Sad!</p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p><strong>Wake and Baker Co. acquires Chris Godwin &amp; Kenneth Walker III, Came acquires D&apos;Andre Swift &amp; Jameson Williams</strong></p>
                <p><br></br></p>
                <p>&quot;The manager who ~agurably~ has one of the saddest teams ever assembled makes a trade with Wake and Baker CEO (proud affiliate of Mayo Corp, subdivision of the large Clout International). And how do we say, he needed it. While Jonah might have hit his quota for the year, he does it by sending away two of his riskiest players, ones upon he&rsquo;s so outspoken that&rsquo;ll you often see their All 22 tape in the chat. Swift, an RB1 managed by a known DHS operative, and the talented but inconsistent Jamo arrived to the Came HQ. Ken Walker arrives to Jonah, and the now almost healthy veteran gets to the roster. While both sides are somewhat even, both managers have to look in fear for the backups, as Zach Chardonnay has already taken some work from Ken, but as fantasy goes along, it&rsquo;s just a bet you have to take. As per the writing of this review and the new revelation discovered by Godwin to come in Week 4 (he discovered CCL) we like the side of Jonah for more consistent production (only predicting Godwin comes back to form). Daniel needs it now, and we give Jonah a B+ and Daniel a B. Daniel has a lot of trade work ahead of him, but many around the league have a hard time communicating with him.&quot;</p>

                <p><strong>WFL Weekly Game of the Week:&nbsp;</strong>Hall of Fame Youtuber (Fabian) vs. I ‚ù§Ô∏è Ohio (Ale)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This week&rsquo;s WFL Weekly Game of the Week features two divisional rivals that have been battling for years. An endless beef that seems to find new ways to add flames to the fire every week, Fabian vs. Alejandro is just about as good as it gets in fantasy football. Just two weeks ago, we saw Travis Kelce from Fab&rsquo;s team hit a Clothesline from Hell on his own teammate, Xavier Worthy, who just so happens to be playing for I ‚ù§Ô∏è Ohio. It&rsquo;s not the first time friendly fire like this has occurred, and it almost assuredly won&rsquo;t be the last given who&rsquo;s involved here. We had the opportunity to sit down with both GMs ahead of their big matchup, and they both had quite a lot to say. Talking to Ale first about his upcoming divisional clash with his rival, he told us &quot;Ah yes, my matchup with the leader of the fantasy cosmos. I circled this one, knowing it would have an effect whether I was 1-1, 2-0, or 0-2. I think importantly as I start to analyze and think of any of the matchups I&rsquo;m afraid of is to realize Fabian has been bested before, despite being an all forsaken fantasy manipulator. Much of my legacy found in the WFL rested on almost losing to Fabian, feeling the pressure of a failed run only to win despite being down and facing the hot Purdy and Crew in the Bay Area. I just have to put my best foot forward and as long as I can put decent numbers, and leave healthy? I&rsquo;ll be good. Trades coming soon (Jere give me Blake C.)&quot; He also said &quot;Also. I called Jere, no ring. AL.&quot; When we asked Fabian about the matchup, he turned the tables on Ale, telling us &quot;Ale has spewed a lot of hostilities leading up to this matchup. I&rsquo;m not certain what the outcome will be, but I know a victory would taste sweet. For someone who complains a lot about lucky strikes, he sure has had a lot of those against me. Let&rsquo;s see if he can keep it going ü•±&quot;. Will I ‚ù§Ô∏è Ohio be able to escape this week unscathed and write another favorable chapter in this rivalry for himself? Or will Hall of Fame Youtuber prove that Ale is the boy who cried wolf, and continue his undefeated start to the season. Let&rsquo;s find out.</li>

                <p><strong>Upset Watch of the Week:</strong> KRAFT YAC &amp; CHEESE (Drew) vs. This is a call for help (Parker)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This week&rsquo;s sneaky upset watch had some contenders, but with strong performances in both Weeks 1 &amp; 2, KRAFT YAC &amp; CHEESE might just have what it takes to take down the #1 team in the WFL so far. Some regression has to be expected for Parker&rsquo;s surprise breakouts Rome Odunze &amp; Drake Maye, and Terry McLaurin &amp; Bill may be playing without star Quarterback Jayden Daniels this week. Add a tough matchup for David Njoku, and things could fall off a bit for This is a call for help. On the flip side, Jalen Hurts &amp; AJ Brown have gotten off to slow starts thus far, and Jordan Mason could be in line for a very big day. Strong performances from those 3 could spell a high-scoring week for Drew&rsquo;s squad. Let&rsquo;s see if KRAFT YAC &amp; CHEESE has what it takes.</li>
