                        <p>{'A breakthrough year with their first playoff appearance in history, gave way to a bombshell dropped in the offseason with Mesa taking a leave of absence effective immediately. The Bang Bros name remained the same, but their office felt a lot emptier than it had been in quite some time. A draft that had many asking questions led to a playoff rematch with the reigning WFL Champion in Jack who spoiled their playoff debut last season. And right on Sunday night when everything was looking bleak and Derrick Henry had seemingly just sealed the deal, Josh Allen and Keon Coleman went to work. They scored, scored again, and continued to score all the way towards bringing the margin all the way down to 2.5 points. And on Monday Night, TJ Hockenson took care of the rest. It‚Äôs an incredible moment for a team that has waded through uncertainty up until this point, and makes you wonder just how far this Andres-led team could go.'}</p>
                        <p>{'We had the chance to sit down with the GM of The Bang Bros and ask him about what the victory meant to him after everything that‚Äôs happened, and what we can expect moving forward from his team. He told us "You‚Äôre absolutely right. It‚Äôs always terrible for the bros to be banging alone especially this season as democracy burns before us. Like any normal, healthy man, you need two to be able to tango and create magic. Unfortunately I lost a bro but this victory means that any man can survive on that 1 nut energy. I can expect and pray for Hailee and J Allen to ride each other as they will¬†hopefully ride me to the championship again this year."'}</p>

Instead, This is a call for help smashed Worse than WHL, scoring an astounding 159.18 points to take a convincing win into Week 2. Puka Nacua, Zay Flowers, and Bijan Robinson all led the way with 20+ point efforts, and solid performances elsewhere made up for a dud from Terry McLaurin.'}</p>

                            <p>{'Fresh off his engagement to global icon Taylor Swift, Kelce was caught hitting on another man‚Ä¶ HARD. So hard in fact, he dislocated the man‚Äôs shoulder. We‚Äôre of course talking about Kelce pulling out a WWE move and taking out his teammate Xavier Worthy on Kansas City‚Äôs opening drive of the game. Last season was Kelce‚Äôs worst since his rookie year statistically, so injuring your competition for targets is certainly a way to improve your numbers and make fantasy owners happy.'}</p>

                        <p>{'We‚Äôre going to try and be gracious with Daniel and his team this season given the circumstances and the expectations being quite low, but if Week One was any indication, it is going to be a long season for Came. Simply put, almost nothing went right for Daniel‚Äôs squad. 3 players in double figures, no kicker started, and an inactive Darnell Mooney in the starting lineup all added up to an abysmal 77.12 points. While it won‚Äôt always be that bad, and Came won‚Äôt end up here too often as long as things don‚Äôt get much worse, any hope of Daniel‚Äôs squad being a surprise dark horse is not looking right now. The 1st ever WFL Commissioner has turned water into wine before, so if there‚Äôs anyone who can pull something out and make his team respectable it‚Äôs him, but this is truly his most daunting task yet.'}</p>

And at the end of the week, there was only one team that had a higher point total than Jack‚Äôs squad. Unfortunately for him, that just so happened to be his opponent. As we‚Äôve detailed above in the Biggest Winner section, it was a historic comeback that sent this team to a shocking 0-1 and spoiled what was looking to be almost a victory lap for the 2 time champ. Jack‚Äôs teams have historically had some crushing losses against Andres-led teams, and this was undoubtedly the worst of all. After the game was over, our reporter asked Jack for comment on the game during his postgame presser, to which all he said was "It doesn‚Äôt feel good to lose.

A tough back and forth matchup with Take us to Valhalla Lamar saw D\'Andre Swift seemingly well on his way to delivering the finishing blow to Andy, and sending Jonah to Week 2 with a 1-0 record. Andddd then Ben Johnson kind of forgor how to use him, the o-line fell apart, and so did the Bears, as Wake and Baker Co. lost by an agonizing 2.68 point margin. In a week where points were hard to come by, scoring 148 points is pretty solid, but the luck of the draw was not in Jonah‚Äôs favor this time around.'}</p>

                        <ul>
                        <li>{"1. Eric or Ale gonna have to get rid of their WR1s by Week 3"}</li>
                        <li>{"2. The draft showed us that having keeper value can trump multiple early picks. Jack, Jeremias, and Fabian‚Äôs teams are arguably stronger than Andy and Parker‚Äôs"}</li>
                        <li>{"3. Two teams from the same division will meet in the WFL Championship, and it will the closest championship game we‚Äôve seen yet."}</li>
                        <li>{"4. I think that‚Äôs Eric‚Äôs underperformance in week 1 will be an afterthought once he makes the playoffs this year."}</li>
                        <li>{"5. I think the Bang Bro has a good squad and I see him going far."}</li>
                        <li>{"6. Right now, Johnny has one of the worst teams in WFL history. When you look at score from week one, over 30% of his points came from Patrick Mahomes, his quarterback, which is a notoriously unreliable position. Plus, Mahomes just lost both his WR1 and WR2. Not to mention that his receivers saw a combined 19 targets, and 8 of those were from Calvin Ridley alone. Not saying that his team can‚Äôt bounce back, but his start to this season is even worse than his point total reflects."}</li>
                        <li>{"7. My number one guarantee is andres gets his first playoff win. bro is locked in on another level. *this does not imply any factors in previous seasons, particularly the past two, were holding him back*"}</li>
                        <li>{"8. An Agudelo will make the first post-draft trade of the season"}</li>
                        <li>{"9. I also believe that while Andres‚Äôs RB room is pretty lackluster (to say the least), I believe in the receivers and QB situation for him enough to make noise"}</li>
                        <li>{"10. Daniel's team might not have been as bad as we thought as long as he remembers to set his line up"}</li>
                        <li>{"11. I truly feel like the managers and staff at How U Gonna Urmmm Naowww Dangg are freaking out over the QB room. I predict a close tilt (more than likely a loss at the hands of a bad QB performance) or a costly locker room addition that will require cutting someone else as to not lose ties with the overdrafted 7th rounder. It may be too early to go JONAHCON 5, but panic is brewing."}</li>
                        <li>{"12. Andres might actually go all the way this year. Allegations for mesa may be approaching at a rapid pace"}</li>
                        <li>{"13. Johnny will begin trading away his whole team by week 4 (I think I have had the same prediction be fulfilled several times)"}</li>
                        <li>{"14. Andres did not save the Bang Bots. Emeka Egbuka and Hollywood Brown are both seeing increased usage due to injuries that should resolve in the next few weeks. At the same time, Josh Allen‚Äôs historic first week inflated both his and Keon Coleman‚Äôs point total. In five weeks we are all going to see that the Bang Bots are neither a juggernaut nor a garbage fire; they have a remarkably okay team."}</li>
                        <li>{"15. I think fabian wins the WFL championship (league over btw)"}</li>
                        <li>{"16. I don‚Äôt think I have as much of a cake walk this season as expected; I think almost all the games will be close"}</li>
                        <li>{"17. Daniel will finish winless and abruptly retire following the end of the season. He will be replaced by a returning Mesa."}</li>
                        <li>{"18. Daniel will complete this season with the triple crown: least wins all time, least points for all time, and a hot ones punishment to boot"}</li>
                        <li>{"19. Johnny will have at least 6 new starters by week 5"}</li>
                        <li>{"20. The dud performances of the top studs and names in the NFL (is causing an overreaction). Jamarr Chase, AJ Brown, several huge names not hitting the already inflated projections. Our staff at HQ are working with the Yahoo interns to fix this. Albeit, a good time to catch value on managers who may be overreacting."}</li>
                        <li>{"21. Eric might have the worst team in the wfl if it wasnt for chase and burrow stack"}</li>

                        <li>{"23. I think daniel shocks the world and makes the playoffs."}</li>
                        <li>{"24. I think I will fall off due to poor management as a lack of time lol"}</li>
                        <li>{"25. We may see our first winless regular season in the WFL from either Johnny or Daniel this year"}</li>
                        <li>{"26. All the goobers who traded draft picks (both trading away and trading for) find limited success and only gods soldiers who remained true to their purest and moral intentions will be contenders and winners of the WFL"}</li>
                        <li>{"27. The WFL continues to become a facsimile of American society.

                            <p>{'It‚Äôs Week 2 and already we have an absolute barnburner on our hands. Two proud and passionate GMs that have had their fair share of success across all fantasy leagues, meet in a clash of eras. The league‚Äôs former Commissioner, Drew, is free from league politics following a rocky end to his tenure last season. With a new fire in his gut, he‚Äôs looking to make a statement this week against his successor and told us "Frankly, I‚Äôve always thought of Andy as a fantasy fraud. He got lucky drafting triple crown winner Cooper Kupp in the third round his first season. He traded away all his players after a disappointing week 1 and finished dead last in 2024. But now he expects me to give him respect because he got a loaded team off the back of Daniel‚Äôs shenanigans and proclaimed himself dictator of the WFL? Nah. I may be the underdog but I‚Äôll be relishing this victory and I can‚Äôt wait to beat him again in Week 13."'}</p>
                            <p>{'The current WFL Commissioner, Andy, might not have the years of experience his predecessor has, but he‚Äôs no stranger to the limelight having reached two WFL Championship Finals, along with a WFL Punishment. He aims to silence his critics this week and simply told us "I‚Äôm excited for the matchup. Many are saying that I‚Äôm already a better commissioner than he is. It should be a nice test. Commish division seems like a cake walk." The temperature with this matchup is at an all-time high, and it shows no signs of cooling off. Will Drew stay undefeated in the Cummish Division at 2-0?

                            <p>{'We caught up with the two fierce rivals earlier to discuss their matchup, and Parker told us "I love facing Johnny.

Johnny was unwavering with his response, telling us that "My only thought against my division 'rival' is to win. I know my projections have me losing but when you go against parker you always gotta have a little confidence going into a matchup against him."
