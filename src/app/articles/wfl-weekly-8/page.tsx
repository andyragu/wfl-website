                    <p>Well&hellip; I think we&rsquo;ve officially reached that point in the WFL Season. More injuries than you can count? ‚úÖ Horrible bye weeks? ‚úÖ Teams starting players that very much should not be started? Hell yeah.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>If there was ever a week that could signify fantasy football&rsquo;s dog days, this would be it.</p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s times like these that really test the mettle of a fantasy football GM; what do you do to brave the storm? Will you trade your way around? Stand pat and ride out the wave? Go down with the ship? With every team in a truly unique situation of their own, each answer is different. And despite some being longer shots than others, a ticket to the dance is still the goal, and still a possibility for all.</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>How will our brave heroes fare as they venture into their toughest battles yet?</p>
                    <p>Only time will tell.</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>Without further ado, let&rsquo;s rock n roll.</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p><strong><span style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>Biggest Winner:</span></strong></p>
                    <p>Wake and Baker Co. (Jonah) - Wow. Talk about a WFL Weekly Game of the Week that delivered. The victor of the epic bout between two heavyweights was none other than Wake and Baker Co., who put together a truly impressive performance to take down one of the top title contenders, and catapult themselves into contender conversations of their own. Jahmyr Gibbs was unstoppable with 36.8 points, Keenan Allen continued to turn back the clock with 28.9, and Trey McBride went off with 29.4 points of his own. When you see those kind of numbers from three players, usually good things follow. Jonah even saw his favorite player Zach Charbonnet score 19.5! &quot;The Hammer&quot; slammed the door on Worse than WHL&apos;s chances, and catapulted Wake and Baker Co. to 5th place and the 3rd highest scoring team in the league thus far. What has certainly been an up and down season for Jonah is showing more and more signs of greatness, and it will be intriguing to see if he can keep things moving in the right direction. Kyle Monangai &amp; Tyrone Tracy at both starting RB spots is certainly not anything to be excited about this week though in a matchup against the ever dangerous Rico Suave.</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p><strong><span style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>Other Winners:</span></strong></p>
                    <p>Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day (Parker) - Parker can finally exhale and breathe a sigh of relief. It wasn&rsquo;t pretty, but the 4 game losing streak is over, and Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day finally has some positive momentum to build off of. New acquisitions Jaylen Warren &amp; Michael Pittman Jr. were instrumental in leading the team to victory, and Drake Maye or Maye not be good is trending up so far. Still with the league&rsquo;s highest scoring offense, Parker hopes his good vibes aren&rsquo;t spoiled this week against an upset-minded Cumming&hellip; team. We will learn a lot about Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day this week I have a feeling.</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>Hall of Fame Youtuber (Fabian) - Speaking of teams that needed a win, Fabian also saw a losing streak come to an end this past week as they sure put up some points in a victory over Cumming&hellip; Matthew Stafford and Davante Adams led the way with an incredible 37 and 26.5 respectively, and Jordan Addison &amp; Josh Jacobs continued their good seasons with some impressive numbers of their own. When this team is on, it&rsquo;s on, and with Travis Hunter FINALLY showing some signs of life, and George Kittle being healthy (donut aside), do not write off Hall of Fame Youtuber despite their struggles of late. If there&rsquo;s anything we can count on, it&rsquo;s a Fabian-led team in contention till season&rsquo;s end and completely shifting the balance of the very foundation of the WFL. Managers beware, something could be brewing in the Hall of Fame Youtuber Chateau once more&hellip;</p>

                    <p>The Bang Bros (Andres) - The now two-week sample size we have for the new look Bang Bros team is not good. Plain and simple, this is bad. Both weeks under 100 points, and nowhere close last week, Andres really wanted to be rid of the Boom or Bust element to his team and we suppose he did just that. Only problem is he got rid of the wrong one, and this is all bust right now. The Running Back situation is truly painful to watch right now, and frankly the only watchable part of this squad is Amon-Ra St. Brown. What started out as a promising campaign has now faded away into obscurity, leaving many to wonder if this team is hurtling towards a potential punishment. We were going to say that Mesa is turning over in his grave right now watching this unfold, but he&rsquo;s enjoying a lot more success in the WHL right now, so his decision to step aside might&rsquo;ve been a smart one after all. Can Andres right the ship and save his season? Or will the allegations and pressure start rolling in?</p>

                    <p>Worse than WHL (Jeremias) - As mentioned earlier, we had a true barnburner in the WFL Weekly Game of the Week, and unfortunately, someone had to lose. That someone was Jeremias, who unfortunately came up just short at the end and missed a golden opportunity to likely climb to the top of many WFL power rankings. While the loss doesn&rsquo;t impact any sort of playoff implications as of yet, it will be interesting to see if it comes into play during the fight for that 1st round playoff bye at season&rsquo;s end. For now, the question of &quot;Can this team win the big one?&quot; is still very much relevant, as a another semi-final loss seems like the most likely outcome once more.</p>

                    <p><strong><span style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>Donuts! (Sponsored by Tough Cookie Inc.):</span></strong></p>
                    <p>THE END IS NIGH. TIME TO RUN AWAY, THE END IS NIGH. Judgement Day has officially hit the WFL and it has spared almost no one. A jelly-filled tsunami washed over the WFL this past week and left nothing but sugary goodness in its wake, as a whopping EIGHT donuts were handed out, each to different teams. It&rsquo;s a lively day here in the WFL Bakery, one that will go down in the record books as one of, if not the highest donut total in this columns history. It&rsquo;s truly a great day for some WFL peasants to be pleasantly pleased by picturesque pastries that prove to be picture perfect, each picked particularly for each person. With bye weeks and injuries forcing our paying customers to make tough choices, look more a healthy batch of donuts to be given out next week as well!</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>üç© Tutu Atwell (Marvin&apos;s Room) - With Deebo Samuel out, Jack needed a big waiver wire streamer to come through in the clutch for him, and Tutu Atwell looked like the guy. No Puka Nacua &amp; decent production in recent weeks seemed like the perfect opportunity for Atwell to have a blow up game. Instead, someone named Konata Mumpfield scored a touchdown, and Tutu ran around a few times in 90 minutes.</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>üç© Mike Evans (Worse than WHL) - This one was a gut punch. In one of season&rsquo;s best matchups, Jeremias needed new acquisition Mike Evans to step up when the lights were brightest and pull him closer to securing a victory and entrench him at 2nd place in the league. Just barely missing two big catches, Mr. Evans put his body on the line and did not come out unscathed, breaking his collarbone in the process. There&rsquo;s no quip in this one, all due respect to one of the GOAT WRs of this era. Unfortunately for Jere that didn&rsquo;t earn him any much needed points though.</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>üç© George Kittle (Hall of Fame Youtuber) - For the first time since Week One, George Kittle was active in Fab&rsquo;s lineup and was a much-needed boost to his team! Or&hellip; let&rsquo;s try that one again. For the first time since Week One, George Kittle was active in Fab&rsquo;s lineup and was a complete non-factor for his team! Big ole donut for you.</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>üç© Jameson Williams (Cumming&hellip;) - Someone needs to find this guy a map, because he has somehow lost his ability to score points. Last week aside, Jamo has been a huge disappointment since signing his big contract extension, and certainly has not been the impact addition Cumming&hellip; had hoped for when they traded for him. Next time he lines up and inevitably runs a Go route, he should probably keep running out of Detroit.</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>üç© Luke McCaffrey (KRAFT YAC &amp; CHEESE) - Jayden Daniels didn&rsquo;t throw his way, and his fate was sealed to the same when Marcus Mariota stepped in the game. A true bust of a start in all facets of the game. If Luke were to go through the process of legally changing his name to Christian, he would solve this problem of his and immediately get spammed with the ball the next time he took the field. Advice is free Drew, pass it along to buddy.</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>üç© TreVeyon Henderson (The Bang Bros) - Well this just might be rock bottom for Andres &amp; Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s relationship. He has certainly not been the stud that many expected thus far, but when you play Running Back for the New England Patriots you have to expect a lack of playing time. The fact that this happened against the worst team in the league might be a sign that it&rsquo;s time to let it go though, I heard The Bang Bros were holding open tryouts for RBs this week in hopes of finding ANYONE that could help them.</p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>üç© Darren Waller (Build The Waller) - Eric turned back the clock by rebuilding the Waller, but this version of him crumbled a lot &nbsp;quicker than even most critics could have predicted. That being said, if I had Tua Tagovailoa as my Quarterback I would want to stay as far away from the field as I possibly could as well.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/EbIMKOUJWEQ?si=-e4sbEtw9h1_Puff"></a></p>
                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/EbIMKOUJWEQ?si=-e4sbEtw9h1_Puff">https://youtu.be/EbIMKOUJWEQ?si=-e4sbEtw9h1_Puff</a></p>
                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>üç© Jayden Higgins (Rico Suave) - Usually when a team takes a WR in the 2nd Round of the Draft, the plan is for them to get targets and catch the ball. I suppose the Texans missed that memo with Higgins who did not see anything catchable come his way last week. While it&rsquo;s no Tua Tagovailoa, old man CJ Stroud (at least that&rsquo;s how he says he feels) has not been very good either. Until literally anything changes for the Houston Texans (eject the OC into the sun is my suggestion), Jayden might be in line for more donuts like this one.</p>

                    <p>Trade to Trade BABBBYYYYY! Whilst we rode a high on Week 7, many thought we would slow down or cede trading in totality. Not this time.

                    <p>We kick off the week with actual trades (I won the last one) with the formers commissioners stricking a deal. Reaching the famous &ldquo;Peach&rdquo; has been a hard task this season, with many managers reporting stalled conversations or seemingly no answers at all. Daniel gets a QB1, and Drew gets at best a FLEX play that&rsquo;s stuck in the kahoots with Pollard. Let&rsquo;s be honest here, Daniel really wanted a piece of the drug being passed around the league, and he won. Drew passes off a QB he didn&rsquo;t need, but Daniel still wins this one.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><br></br></p>
                    <p>This is a special editorial on one of the most famous mangers of our holy league, Johnny. From a man who asks for trades every single day, it almost feels special to take a look at how far he has come.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The week 1 lineup (barring Hindsight Bias of course) was a tough place to start for Johnny. Not being able to draft for what seemed like forever, this manager had shot himself in the foot months before members decided to meet at his apartment for the draft. Today, it&rsquo;s certainly made some leaps and bounds and has some light at the end of the tunnel sitting at 3-4. We can take a hard look back at some of the Trade To Trade editions and come to the conclusion ourselves, we are scratching our heads at some of these deals. Is it an addiction, boredom, wanting to spice things up? We don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>WFL Weekly Game of the Week:&nbsp;</strong>Cumming&hellip; (Daniel) vs. Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day (Parker) - This selection may come as a shock to many, but don&rsquo;t let their numbers in the standing fool you. This is going to be a true battle. Cumming&hellip; &amp; Daniel have been especially plucky in recent weeks, putting up respectable numbers given their situation, and are looking like they might just have another surprise or two in the tank for an unsuspecting opponent. Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day were able to snap their 4-game skid last week to end a painful stretch of games, and look to get back to the winning ways they saw earlier in the season when things were clicking. A two-headed monster at RB leads the way for Parker&rsquo;s squad, as this team will go as far as Bijan Robinson &amp; De&apos;Von Achane can carry it. Daniel&rsquo;s team embodies the phrase &quot;group effort&quot;, but DeVonta Smith, Tyler Warren, and D&apos;Andre Swift have been real bright spots in a not so positive season for Cumming&hellip; This may be Daniel&rsquo;s last chance to make a push towards any kind of meaningful fantasy football going forward, and he certainly has an opportunity to get it done. In his way stands a team and GM that has been searching for an identity the whole season. Are they a contender or pretender? Do you hear it? Is there an upset potentially Cumming&hellip;? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>
