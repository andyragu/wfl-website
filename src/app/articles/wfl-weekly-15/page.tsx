It&rsquo;s a gloomy day for a building that has held much mystique throughout the years. Long gone are the days where WFL staffers ran around in panic trying to put out fires and remedy scandals from the Daniel administration. The days of a Drew-led regime that saw draft picks fly around like fruit flies in a farmer&rsquo;s market, a thing of the past. As Andy stared out the window of the Commissioner&rsquo;s office, he felt a twinge of sadness. Ultimately, like those who came before him, the pressures that were heaped upon his shoulders became too much for a man to bear. His reign as Commissioner, one that started with such hope and enthusiasm, now coming to an abrupt end. In the distance he could see the moving van with the last of his things being packed in, an appropriately as he turned to leave, the WFL HQ music system began to softly play a tune befitting the long walk one final time.</span></p>

While he certainly had his work cut out for him in cleaning up the mess that draft-pick trades had left, it&rsquo;s the other promises and ideas that had wildly varying levels of success. The lows were low: A division system imported that seemed to be cared about very little by its founder, and a league schedule that reflected that notion. But the highs were high: WFL Weekly&rsquo;s website up and running, dragging the Chief Editor out of contemplating retirement, only for WFL Weekly to be enjoying a career renaissance. They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and we think that&rsquo;s the only way to view Andy&rsquo;s body of work as the Commissioner of the WFL. While it may have been short-lived, the way we here at WFL Weekly see it, is through a classic saying: &quot;The brightest stars burn the fastest&quot;</span></p>

                    <p><span data-tt='{"paragraphStyle":{"alignment":4,"writingDirection":1}}' style={{ whiteSpace: "pre-wrap" }}>I ❤️ Ohio (Ale) - It&rsquo;s hard to understate just how impactful I ❤️ Ohio&rsquo;s win was this past week. Not only did he knock out a division-rival. Not only did he secure a Top 3 finish this season. Not only did he beat a team that he will likely forever be tied to. He crushed the dreams of Hall of Fame Youtuber and Fabian in one of the most dramatic conclusions to a regular season the WFL has ever seen. After Mahomes completely sold in a prime spot for Ale to remain in striking distance, it seemed all was lost. But then Dicker the kicker went to work. And with every field goal things began to get closer. The score got tighter. And other GMs started to believe. 20 points from Cameron Dicker sent Ale to the post-season on a positive note, and Fabian to a heart-breaking season-ending defeat.</span></p>

                    <p><span data-tt='{"paragraphStyle":{"alignment":4,"writingDirection":1}}' style={{ whiteSpace: "pre-wrap" }}>Wabi Sabi (Andy) - All seemed lost when Wabi Sabi simply was blown out of the water by division rival Cumming&hellip; and Daniel. Jalen Hurts produced perhaps the worst stat-line in WFL history to the tune of -7 points, and we were just minutes away from without question the biggest failure of a season in WFL history. But just as you give some things away, fate has a funny way of doing what you&rsquo;d least expect. Fabian&rsquo;s loss is Andy&rsquo;s gain, as a Monday Night Miracle provides Wabi Sabi with something six other teams can&rsquo;t say they have: a chance to play for a championship. Andy&rsquo;s squad has truly stumbled into this position, but we&rsquo;ve seen times before that even the tiniest of underdogs can bark the loudest. Is Wabi Sabi next on that list.</span></p>

A victory in a competitive matchup against KRAFT YAC &amp; CHEESE was not only solidified the position of On the Cock, but served as a statement win for the rest of the WFL. Give this team an opening and they might just run away with the whole thing. Let&rsquo;s see long this fire can burn.</span></p>

And for a while it looked like it would Andy&rsquo;s Wabi Sabi team. But oh how fate has a cruel way of playing tricks on those they&rsquo;ve helped in the past. Despite a less than stellar performance, all seemed to right going into Monday Night Football. Donuts from former team hero Patrick Mahomes, and Dontayvion Wicks stuck Fabian in a truly ideal spot. And then 5 words were typed. Those damn 5 words. &quot;See yall in the playoffs&quot;. It was almost the cruel opposite of a tactic known very well by Fabian&rsquo;s opponent. Essentially what was an early gg, turned the tables on what we already knew. Fabian tried to cite the ancient texts of the art of &apos;early gg&apos; to Ale. What he didn&rsquo;t foresee was that the GM of I ❤️ Ohio was there when it was written.</span></p>

There&rsquo;s not many ways you sugarcoat this (and believe us, the WFL Bakery excels at that), Jalen Hurts had one of the worst performances in WBWA-WFL combined history this past week. To put things in persepective, Andy&rsquo;s own girlfriend Lisandra could have scored more points, and she likely could have done it with her eyes closed. We actually reached out to her to get her thoughts on Andy&rsquo;s monumentally bad start, and her thoughts on his actions recently. She told us &quot;All I have to say is that this past week was traumatic, to say the least. I have no idea how he managed to win (make the playoffs) last week, and naturally I&rsquo;m thrilled, ecstatic even. That being said, for the sake of my sanity and his own, someone please ban him from next year&rsquo;s fantasy football.&quot;</span></p>

Fabian should be able to avoid the punishment with the WFL&rsquo;s Stack of the Year: Matt Stafford and Davante Adams.

The Bang Bros were right in the thick of it at 2-2 after 4 weeks, but lack of early season production from those rookies over the next two weeks led Andres to a full roster overhaul in Week 6, and he has gone 2-6 since then. That leads us to today, where despite early season woes, Andres still has a chance to avoid doing yet another punishment by sticking to his guns. Specifically Bang Bros legend ARSB and Miami Dolphins WR1 of the future Jaylen Waddle. Toss in the Lions stack with Jared Goff and a little bit of luck, and Andres should be able to avoid doing the punishment for the third time in five years.</span></p>

Big performances from Devonta Smith and Jamo have been regular occurrences of late, and he&rsquo;s built himself a nice roster around Swift, Warren, and Herbert to round out the season.

Equipped with nothing but mid-round picks, he managed to take at least a glance at a playoff berth while scoring only 29 more points than Daniel. He&rsquo;s scraped by all season, curating a roster that functions almost as an island of misfit toys, where one man&rsquo;s waiver wire cut candidate is Johnny&rsquo;s RB2. But we in no way think that his win total is reflective of the strength of his team at the current moment. He&rsquo;ll have to ride late-season surges from his diamonds in the rough - Jakobi Meyers, Devaughn Vele, and Tyrone Tracy to avoid the same fate as his brother, but downturns in production from Emeka &ldquo;Keeper Value&rdquo; Egbuka and Quentin &ldquo;Can Catch?&rdquo; Johnston doesn&rsquo;t help his chances.

The big story of Andy stepping down as Commissioner has cooled off, and what we&rsquo;re left with is this: Ale and I ❤️ Ohio are the sole reason Wabi Sabi are playing playoff football this week. He let him in, and now he&rsquo;s trying to take him out. Will Ale stamp on the Cinderella dreams of the former commissioner before they have a chance to materialize? With his self-imposed shackles off, Wabi Sabi can now solely focus on the playoffs. This renewed focus could unlock a potential we&rsquo;ve seen throughout the season, but one that&rsquo;s never been fully realized.
