                    <p>A WFL Weekly Tradition is BACK. In years past, WFL Weekly celebrated Thanksgiving with a special themed week. Gone are the basic section titles, and in their place are Thanksgiving specialties. We here at WFL Weekly would like to give a huge thanks to all of our readers, contributors, sponsors, and to anyone that&rsquo;s supported us this season. It hasn&rsquo;t been easy, but we are staying strong this season and haven&rsquo;t missed a week yet!</p>
                    <p>We&rsquo;d like to encourage everyone for at least this week to try and be positive about the great thing we all get to share together, fantasy football. Each of us have different jobs, interests, hobbies, etc., but fantasy football is the common denominator that always brings us together. And I think sometimes we forget that. We will continue to try and be a positive light that shines through for those who still wish to see it. But enough yapping from me, enjoy this special edition of WFL Weekly!</p>
                    <p>Without further ado, let&rsquo;s rock n roll</p>
                    
                    <h2>Winner Winner, Turkey Dinner!</h2>
                    <p>Wake and Baker Co. (Jonah) - Another playoff berth clinched, and this one belongs to the boys in Wake and Baker Co. Jonah&rsquo;s squad vanquished Qui Gyatt Jit in a tough matchup ,and now sit just a win and an I ❤️ Ohio loss away from securing a 1st Round Bye as well. We got in contact with Jonah recently and asked him about his feelings regarding his team&rsquo;s performance as of late, and if he feels this is his year. Jonah told us &quot;I can&rsquo;t say I am surprised by my team&rsquo;s performance, because this is just what you come to expect from a Mayo Corp/Clout International affiliate. I think Wake and Baker Co. has what it takes to finally make a run at the chip because of the roster construction. Josh Allen is widely considered as the fantasy QB1. Jahmyr Gibbs is fighting for the RB1 spot, and just may get it with Ragnow back in the mix. Trey McBride has become otherwordly since Brissett took over. This roster has some serious pillars that have helped us to succeed despite injuries/bye weeks.&quot;</p>

                    <h2>Succulent Side Dishes</h2>
                    <p>Marvin&rsquo;s Room (Jack) - Don&rsquo;t look now, but there&rsquo;s just might be a bad moon rising once more. Considered to be just about done when they lost to Rico Suave to drop to 3-6, the only path to the playoffs was simple: win, win, and win some more. So far Marvin&rsquo;s Room has done just that, winning their last three game to climb back to .500 and could not be closer to a playoff spot if it jumped into bed with them. 3.1 points separate Jack&rsquo;s squad from 5th place, and 0.06 point from 6th place. Key to their success has been the unbelievable play of Jaxon Smith-Njigba, the improvement of Derrick Henry, and the emergence of Wan&apos;Dale Robinson. Is this one more comeback to defy all odds? Or is it just a prolonged flash in the pan like has been the story all season? We&rsquo;ll find out in against Hall of Fame Youtuber in what is almost a play-in game.</p>
                    <p>On the Cock (Parker) - Parker changed his team name and won? Hmmm maybe WFL Weekly was onto something huh?</p>

                    <h2>The Deep Fried Turkey Your Uncle Tries to Make that Goes Up in Flames</h2>
                    <p>Forever Worse than WHL (Jere) - Well it feels like the sinking ship is just about fully submerged now. To give you the full picture, we will post our full most recent interview with Jeremias.</p>
                    <p>WFL Weekly: &quot;The slow crumble of your team&rsquo;s record came to what could be the finishing blow last week, in a tough loss to your division rival Parker. Despite your path to the playoffs becoming more and more dim, what message are you sending to your team during the WFL&rsquo;s final march towards postseason play?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jere: &quot;It&apos;s over&quot;</p>

                    <h2>Beets &amp; Solidified Cranberry Sauce</h2>
                    <p>Shitter Inc. (Eric) - An absolutely brutal loss for Shitter Inc. last week, as Eric&rsquo;s squad fell just short of stealing a win from divisional rival I ❤️ Ohio. Had the Buccaneers been able to muster ANY sort of fight against the Rams, we could be seeing Shitter Inc. up there fighting for those last couple playoff spots at 6-6, but now things need to go VERY VERY right for Eric to have a chance at the playoffs. A game against Wake and Baker Co. this week is not exactly helping that possibility.</p>
                    <p>Qui Gyatt Jit (Andy) - Another week, another tough loss for Qui Gyatt Jit, who has seen a strong team struggle as of late. Andy&rsquo;s squad has its back against the wall now in more ways than one, and sees teams like Marvin&rsquo;s Room breathing right down their neck looking to steal a playoff spot. Can Nico Collins and Saquon Barkley get back to their peaks? Qui Gyatt Jit&rsquo;s success may be tied to the answers of both questions. The playoffs almost begin this week for Andy who needs his team to lock in in order to avoid a catastrophic collapse.</p>

                    <h2>Donuts! (Sponsored by Tough Cookie Inc.)</h2>
                    <p>This week we&rsquo;ve got a special treat straight from the creative minds at Tough Cookie Inc., as we introduce our Up and Autumn Thanksgiving Donut! Filled with the classic holiday flavors you know and love, the pumpkin pie donut base, cinnamon-vanilla frosting, with a crushed homemade cookie crumble on top is sure to be at the top of your list of things you&rsquo;re thankful for this year! And customers are sure lining up out the door to try it&hellip;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🍩 Dalton Kincaid (The Bang Bros) - Uhhh well the hangover from the previous week&rsquo;s loss in the WFL Weekly Game of the Week must&rsquo;ve been a bad one, because Kincaid was ruled out well before kickoff. Classic sleepy GM move.</li>
                        <li>🍩 David Njoku (On the Cock) - Is this Njok to u? The loss of Sam LaPorta is now looming very large.</li>
                        <li>🍩 Jameson Williams (Cumming&hellip;) Off the heels of 3 great performances, Jameson Williams followed that up with a classic donut. Fortunately for Daniel it didn&rsquo;t matter. Unfortunately it would&rsquo;ve at least made things respectable as he scored 61.42 points. Oof.</li>
                        <li>🍩 Jordan Addison (Hall of Fame Youtuber) - Not only is Addison dropping passes, but he has one of the players of all-time in JJ McCarthy throwing him the ball too. So it kinda makes sense. Thankfully, &quot;Nine&quot; bonked his head last week so better times are indeed ahead.</li>
                        <li>🍩 Rashid Shaheed (Hall of Fame Youtuber) - So nice he had to do it twice. More like Rashid ShaHide &amp; Go Seek the way we are not seeing this man do anything since being traded to the Seahawks.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As the Trade Deadline came and went, we here at WFL Weekly would like to thank Ale for his wonderful writing this year in Trade to Trade. WFL Weekly truly would not be what it is today without your creative mind. Here&rsquo;s to more trading just to trade &#x1f91f;&#x1f3fb;</p>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Drew (KRAFT YAC &amp; CHEESE), Jonah (Wake and Baker Co.), and Alejandro (I ❤️ Ohio)</h3>
                    <p>We said in the intro that there are only three playoff spots remaining, and that&apos;s because Alejandro has actually already clinched, even though he doesn&apos;t have a star next to his name yet - Yahoo is just stupid. Let&apos;s explain.</p>
                    <p>In order for Ale to miss the playoffs, he would need to lose his next two games, and all 4 of the 6-6 teams would have to win both of their games and beat him out on points (it&apos;s not possible for a 5-7 team to knock him out). However, two of the 6-6 teams play each other this week (Jack and Fabian), so it is not possible for Ale to fall out of playoff contention.</p>
                    <p>So, Drew, Jonah, and Ale have all clinched playoff spots and these next two weeks will just be jockeying for position. As things stand, Jonah has a 98.41% chance of securing a first round bye and Drew has a 98.37% chance of securing a first round bye. These are the top two teams, and barring outside scenarios, they are likely to end up resting in week 15. However, Alejandro has a 3.1% chance of stealing the number 2 seed and a measley 0.12% chance of taking the number 1 seed.</p>
                    <p>For the number 2 seed: Ale wins two straight + Drew loses two straight (Ale wins the tiebreak on points) OR Jonah loses one (Ale wins the tiebreak on points) OR Jonah loses two straight</p>
                    <p>For the number 1 seed: Same as above, but one of the two Jonah scenarios would also have to happen.</p>

                    <h3>Andres (The Bang Bros) and Daniel (Cumming&hellip;)</h3>
                    <p>The Honorable Peach was unfortunately eliminated from playoff contention after a long and tumultuous season, leaving him as the first GM to enter the toilet bowl. We think he may be on an irreversible crash course with the Hot Wings, and we are praying for Ale&apos;s toilet if that is indeed the case. We hope he is more competitive next season with a full arsenal of draft picks under his command for the first time since 2023. And although Andres&apos; loss to Jack last week didn&apos;t technically eliminate him from playoff contention, the probability of him making the playoffs is near 0. The best that The Bang Bros can possibly finish is 6-8. Making the playoffs would require 2 of the 6-6 teams to lose two straight games, and all of the 5-7 teams to lose at least one game. This is the only scenario in which The Bang Bros can make it, and even then it would require a point tiebreak where they make up 100 points over the next two weeks. We&apos;ll keep an eye on this one, which would be the ULTIMATE chaos scenario.</p>

                    <h3>On the Cock (Parker), Hall of Fame Youtuber (Fabian), Qui Gyatt Jit (Andy), and Marvin&apos;s Room (Jack)</h3>
                    <p>You cannot talk about light without speaking of darkness, day without speaking of night, and you cannot talk about Jack&apos;s playoff dreams without speaking of Fabian. This week we are witnessing probably the most influential regular season game in WFL history. Marvin&apos;s Room vs Hall of Fame Youtuber, both 6-6, separated by a slim 3 points, squaring off in a do-or-die game. Currently, Fabian sits at a 51.16% chance to make the playoffs and Jack sits at 47.94%. If Fabian wins, his odds shoot up to 80.7% and Jack&apos;s drop to 23.04%. Conversely, if Jack wins, his odds shoot up to 78.85% and Fabian&apos;s drop to 21.51%. That is a near 60% swing in playoff odds. As far as we can tell, there are no clinching scenarios for these teams, but get your popcorn ready.</p>
                    <p>Parker has the one thing that the rest of these teams fighting for a playoff spot do not: Points. He currently has a 96.62% chance of making the playoffs, and it&apos;s win-and-in for him the next 2 weeks. The Fabian vs Jack matchup is extremely helpful to Parker because that means even if he loses, he&apos;ll have the tiebreak over another 6-6 team that lost and whatever 5-7 teams that win this week. It should be smooth sailing for the Man of Long Names, but if he loses two games his playoff odds drop to 38.6%, and that&apos;s without factoring in any other scenarios.</p>
                    <p>Andy is the most peculiar of the 6-6 teams because the games he plays don&apos;t really affect the rest of the standings all that much and he is therefore in control of his own destiny. Qui Gyatt Jit plays KRAFT YAC &amp; CHEESE and Cumming&hellip; in back to back weeks, both of which are teams that have either clinched or are eliminated from playoff contention, essentially making no impact on the standings relative to some of the other games we are seeing. He doesn&apos;t have enough points to confidently say that he is win-and-in, but he will need to finish 7-7 with a tiebreak at a minimum to make the playoffs as right now Qui Gyatt Jit has a 58.71% chance of making it.</p>

                    <h3>Forever Worse than WHL (Jeremias), Shitter Inc. (Eric), and Rico Suave (Johnny)</h3>
                    <p>Here&apos;s a fun fact for you: There are more 5-7 teams that have a chance to finish as the 4 seed than the 6-6 teams. You read that right. On the Cock is favored with a 82.79% chance to finish in 4th, but the only other non-clinched teams that can finish as the 4th seed are Jeremias at 2.28% and Johnny at 1.21%. It&apos;s unlikely but hey, crazier things have happened. All of these teams need to win in weeks 13-14 and they also need some help elsewhere. Any loss causes playoff odds to plummet to near zero and in some cases results in full blown elimination.</p>
                    <p>The most important matchup for the 5-7 teams happens in Week 14, when Johnny and Jeremias square off. So depending on how things go this week, we could be looking at another Jack vs. Fabian level showdown for a playoff bid. Assuming both teams win and are headed into Week 14 at 6-7 (6 7), Jeremias would have a 67.73% chance to make the playoffs, whereas Johnny would be at 11.07%. Both teams would improve to 7-7 with two straight wins, and that would put Jere at 90.45% chance of making the playoffs given his current points, and Johnny way down at 43.24% as his points deficit will likely be too much to overcome. Those odds are way better than where they currently stand at 37.4% and 1.27% respectively, so better get to winning boys.</p>
                    <p>As the odd man out from Johnny and Jere&apos;s Week 14 powwow, Eric is the 5-7 team&apos;s biggest hater, and for good reason. He likely won&apos;t be able to make up the current 90 point deficit to Jeremias within two weeks (but we&apos;ve seen crazier), so he needs him to lose at least one game over the next two weeks. Similarly, he also needs Johnny to lose a game over the next two weeks. The problem is, one of them is guaranteed to win in Week 14, so Eric will be praying on their downfall this week to ensure himself breathing room as he tries to move up the standings and snag that last playoff spot, just as he did when he captured his first WFL Championship. With two straight wins, Eric&apos;s playoff odds rise from 6.9% all the way to 49.12%. But couple that with Johnny and Jere losses this week and he&apos;s all the way up at 62.47% - not too shabby.</p>

                    <h2>A Feast Fit For a King</h2>
                    <p>With two weeks left in the regular season, the contenders and pretenders are starting to really reveal themselves to us. Who has the &apos;It&apos; Factor, and who does not? Last week we asked about who WFL GMs would like to see lose the league and do the punishment; this week, we asked each GM who they would want to see win it all if they couldn&rsquo;t take home the trophy themselves, and this is what they said.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Parker</strong> - &quot;Out of everybody, it&rsquo;d have to be Drew. He&rsquo;s been a fun guy to talk to over the years so I&rsquo;d have to root for him.&quot;</li>
                        <li><strong>Jere</strong> - &quot;Fab, so the league can be deleted&quot;</li>
                        <li><strong>Eric</strong> - &quot;the player i would absolutely love to take the championship this year is fabian. The league would finally be able to rest in peace and it would be the end of the WFL as we know it.&quot;</li>
                        <li><strong>Jonah</strong> - &quot;If not me, I would like to see Parker win the championship. I think he made the right moves last year to set himself up for success this year (even if people are mad he got two first round picks, it was a legal move at the time). He has made the right trades and remains on my heels for the lead in Points For. I would be more than happy to play him for the chip this year&quot;</li>
                        <li><strong>Andy</strong> - &quot;If I&rsquo;m not the winner this year with 2 first round picks 2 second round picks and 2 third round picks I rather see the league explode. I DO NOT want to see anyone else win.&quot;</li>
                        <li><strong>Johnny</strong> - &quot;if not me, i think the only person id be satisfied with winning the league would be jack reid or parker, never upset about a comeback story in reference to jack and ill always back parkers success although hes a rival&quot;</li>
                        <li><strong>Ale</strong> - &quot;Mr.Jack ; great question. I think my pick for my wished winner has to be Parker, without a doubt. Starting his WFL &apos;25 as a &quot;co-commish&quot; to then seeming to lose the job throughout our Bible Quote / AI era, I wouldn&apos;t want anyone else to win the league. Some may say the league may end, but I genuinely think a Parker win will be a reset of the league. Johnny would be cured of his ailment, the &quot;ball knowers&quot; and &quot;PA investigators&quot; will have to look themselves in the mirror and accept our TRUE commissioner won the league. Fabian on the other hand, is a reset in a whole sense of the word. Reset in the literal word is the end of fantasy as we know it, and do we really want that? I suppose we do. But I need a Parker win before that happens. Beer.&quot;</li>
                        <li><strong>Jack</strong> - &quot;If it&apos;s not I who hoists the WFL Championship Trophy this season, I would like Ale or Eric to win it all. Quite simply, I&apos;m enjoying having 3 GMs in the WFL Champions Club Suite, and would like it to stay that way for the foreseeable future.&quot;</li>
                        <li><strong>Andres</strong> - <em>*Not able to be reached for comment*</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Fabian</strong> - &quot;I think it would be fun to see Parker win. He has the squad to do it. If he locks in and makes wise decisions in to give himself the best chance possible, he might just pull it off&quot;</li>
                        <li><strong>Drew</strong> - &quot;I would like to see Jonah as the winner of the WFL this season. As one of the ethical teams in the top 6, I have a lot of respect for what he has been able to accomplish this season and if I can&apos;t win, I think Jonah deserves it.&quot;</li>
                        <li><strong>Daniel</strong> - <em>*Not able to be reached for comment but it&apos;s excused this week*</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Mesa</strong> - &quot;WFL title on the line&hellip; GIMME JONAH&quot;</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Papa&rsquo;s Picks</h2>

                    <h3>WFL Weekly Game of the Week: KRAFT YAC &amp; CHEESE (Drew) vs. Qui Gyatt Jit (Andy)</h3>
                    <p>This game has all the makings of a potential future playoff matchup in a couple of weeks. The question is if Qui Gyatt Jit can make it there. Andy&rsquo;s team desperately needs a win and he knows it. Matter of fact, he&rsquo;s dipping deep into his bag of tricks this week. Andy: The margin for error is quite literally razor-thin for his team as he enters the last two weeks of the regular season. With his proverbial back against the wall, Andy faces not only a division rival, but the league leading Drew and KRAFT YAC &amp; CHEESE. With pressure mounting and squarely on jis shoulders, we asked how he deals with said pressure ahead of this massive matchup.</p>
                    <p>Andy told us &quot;This week my players and I will be doing a Haka to intimidate Drew&rsquo;s players since they can&rsquo;t do much else. So we&rsquo;ve been preparing a special haka all this week.&quot; Get ready Drew, this is getting serious.</p>
                    <p>The current #1 team in the league is already well in the playoffs at this point, but do not think he isn&rsquo;t taking this game seriously. We talked to the former Commissioner about how close he is to securing a 1st round bye, and how sweet it would be to do it over his replacement.</p>
                    <p>Drew told us &quot;I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I wasn&rsquo;t nervous for this matchup. Andy was one of only two teams to beat me so far this season so I&rsquo;ve had this one circled since week 2. He&rsquo;s going to be a formidable opponent once again, especially with Chase receiving passes from Burrow and Higgins sitting in my IR spot. I wish Andy luck this week, but just because I have a playoff spot locked up doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll be taking it easy on him. I think everyone in the WFL deserves a fair chance at making the playoffs, so we&rsquo;ll let the cards fall where they may.&quot;</p>

                    <h3>Upset Watch of the Week: Shitter Inc. (Eric) vs. Wake &amp; Baker Inc. (Jonah)</h3>
                    <p>Circle this one on your calendars. When Eric &amp; Jonah get together you just know chaos is coming soon. Wake and Baker Co. put B2A in the first meeting between these two earlier this year, but both teams are far from the squads they were at this point. Does Eric have what it takes to see his squad continue to fight for playoff glory? Or is the unstoppable wave of Jonah just too much to handle? Let&rsquo;s hear what both GMS said of their matchup this week.</p>
                    <p>Erick told us &quot;this matchup is a pretty big matchup this week against the group leader. this week is also the return of joe brrr which will make an immediate impact. he&apos;s playing a weak ravens defense and if he can play the way he can in his return i think i will have a good chance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jonah told us &quot;Though we are fighting for the elusive First Round Bye, I don&apos;t think its a huge priority for our organization. The goal is to get in to the playoffs. Seeding and byes don&apos;t matter, as long as you win your matchup. I think this mindset is what sets us apart and could help us to get past Eric&apos;s team this week.&quot;</p>
