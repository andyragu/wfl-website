It has been revealed that the Injury Bug is a highly contagious virus that first appears in one player, and quickly spreads to others on the roster, rendering them completely unable to compete for weeks if not months on end. Some serious cases have led to players missing the whole season. The fent folding team facility has seen the most severe of cases thus far, with Ceedee Lamb and Mike Evans passing the Injury Bug to Lamar Jackson as well. Elsewhere, Cumming&hellip; is just beginning to work its way through an Injury Bug that passed through their team, as James Conner, Austin Ekeler, and Ricky Pearsall have all been hit hard. Fuhuluhtoogans has also been a team that has been hit hard by the Injury Bug, watching Joe Burrow &amp; Jayden Reed pass the virus to Tyreek Hill as well. The most recent case developing sees Bucky Irving and Trey Benson from Marvin's Room as the team&rsquo;s first documented cases. </span></p>

One of the most storied rivalries in the league, the Agudelo Bowl has seen its share of absolute barn burners and clunkers alike. This may have fallen short of high scoring expectations, but the result is arguably one of the most important. The WFL will not have a winless team this season despite a wide belief from other GMs that this would be the case. Just like a journeyman QB, Rico Suave has taken their lumps and seen faces come and go, but they&rsquo;ve gotten better as the fight has gone on, and feel like they might just be rounding into form. A huge battle with Cumming&hellip; this week will decide the occupant of the WFL&rsquo;s basement in what should be a truly entertaining bout if nothing else. </span></p>

Last week, the Final Boss Bang Bros showed up, scoring a league high on the season, 187.4 points, which was enough to take down a high flying Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day. In four weeks, The Bang Bros have scored 163.9, 105, 126.8, and now 187.4. To say that&rsquo;s a bit of a discrepancy would be an understatement. Andres is watching his WR trio of terror absolutely firing on all cylinders, as Amon Ra St. Brown, Drake London, and Emeka Egbuka all scored 20+ points in what was a huge win for The Bang Bros Brand. What do we expect this week against Worse than WHL and Jeremias? Your guess is as good as ours. </span></p>

Things were already taking a downturn in the points scoring department for Fab&rsquo;s squad, but the season ending injury to Malik&rsquo;s Nabers has dealt this team a painful blow that it might not be able to recover from. For a GM that tends not to trade too often, perhaps more deals are on the way to try and fix this roster. Hall of Fame Youtuber sure could use some fantasy football advice right now. </span></p>

The previously undefeated Commissioner suffered not only from multiple injuries, but also a humiliating defeat in this year&rsquo;s Agudelo Bowl. Putting up a paltry 94 points against Big Bro is not what we&rsquo;re used to from an Andy-led team, who will have to brave the storm in a tough matchup against Parker this week.

Just how far can this team fly? Will AJ Brown ever return to former glory?

The bright spot for Jeremias is obviously his RB depth, as JT is having a resurgent year under Indiana Jones and CMC is harnessing the life force of every other 49ers player to stay healthy. Pair that with a young rising player like Judkins and CTE enthusiast Cam Skattebo, and you have the best RB room in the league. If good health continues and some NFL teams make good real-life decisions (Bengals trade for Jameis, Steelers banish Arthur Smith, and Jaguars give BTJ hand replacement surgery), then we could see Jere move up a few spots. </span></p>

Fortunately, all-time Wussies nickname legends Amon Jah, Egg on my Buka, and Kendrick American make up probably the best WR room in the league this year. And of course Josh Allen doesn&rsquo;t hurt either.

Early-season injuries to Lamar, CeeDee, and Mike Evans bump him down a few pegs, and the mega-deal with Eric and Jeremias is clearly not going his way thus far. When his team starts getting healthy we&rsquo;ll probably see him move up the Hierarchy, but blowing all your FAAB and then starting Darius Slayton is generally not the position you want to be in. </span></p>

And that&rsquo;s really been the story for Fuhuluhtoogens thus far, as an injury-riddled start to the season which included Joe Burrow and Jayden Reed. The effectively destroyed not only Burrow&rsquo;s value, but 1st overall selection Jamarr Chase&rsquo;s as well, which leaves this team relying on young stars TMac and Ashton Jeanty. We think Eric has done well to manage his team through adversity thus far, and things could continue looking up as his rookies gain more footing in the NFL. </span></p>

The irony for Fabian is he IS one of those higher powers and yet couldn&rsquo;t save his own team. After strategically placing Travis Kelce to take out Xavier Worthy in Week 1 to ensure he wouldn&rsquo;t be available in Week 3 for his matchup against I ‚ù§Ô∏è Ohio, it seems karmic retribution is finally catching up to this team. An incredibly unfortunate injury to Malik Nabers sends Fabian cratering down the ranks. Paired with underperformance from supposed two-way superstar Travis Hunter and Chase Brown, Fabian finds himself with an uphill climb if he&rsquo;s going to make the playoffs. </span></p>

Unfortunately, he finds himself down near the bottom after a series of trades that seem to have left him right back where he started. Time is a flat circle. We thought his team was really looking up after the acquisition of Javonte Williams and a bounce-back performance by Omarion Hampton following a disappointing few weeks to start the season. Johnny decided to trade his star power for depth, and we don&rsquo;t necessarily blame him in this wild world of injuries. It&rsquo;ll all depend on how these newly acquired players shake out, as well as Rashee Rice&rsquo;s performance upon return, but for now he finds himself near the bottom of the hierarchy. </span></p>

He flew too close to the sun and got burned, mortgaging too much draft capital in hopes of a WFL championship last season. Unfortunately, the fantasy gods continue to smite him as punishment for his wrongdoings by taking away both James Conner and Austin Ekeler for the season. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean the Peach is down and out. Strategic waiver pickups in Woody Marks and Justin Fields could see this scrappy team start to make a turn around. We don&rsquo;t see this team moving up too high in the power rankings, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean a few close wins can&rsquo;t change his fortune in the WFL standings. </span></p>

Despite the self-inflicted hardships that both GMs have burdened themselves with this season. Both beat the winless allegations, and are now battling it out to incredibly move into playoff contention. The job that each has done to make their teams at least competitive is definitely impressive, and they should receive their flowers for that feat. This week could be a turning point for one team, but an early funeral for the other.

While Marvin's Room is dealing with a couple of key injuries limiting their ceiling this week, KRAFT YAC &amp; CHEESE are missing key players on bye, making this week a lot tougher on paper than it seems like it should be.
